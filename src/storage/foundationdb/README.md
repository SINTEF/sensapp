# SensApp and FoundationDB

[FoundationDB](https://www.foundationdb.org) is a distributed key-value database, [that can be used for time-series](https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/time-series.html).

## No implementations yet

FoundationDB doesn't have an easy and pure rust client, so we have no plans to implement it yet.
